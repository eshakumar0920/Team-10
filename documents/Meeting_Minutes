Team leader will update the week's meeting minutes here. The Meeting Minutes should provide an overall summary of what was discussed during each weekly meeting.

Week 1 - 2.14.25
Attendees: Prof Alagar, TA Thenn, Team 10 (entire team)
Note Taker: Sophia
Team Leader: Patrick
  Summary:
    In this meeting our team presented our Project Proposal to both the TA and Prof. Alagar. Patrick, as the team leader, began the presentation by describing the overall
    summary of the project while sharing the document to the screen so it was able to be viewed by the whole meeting. As the presentation continued, the professor noted that
    the proposal looked very detailed and was a good start to the project. Further into the presentation the TA suggested that our team modify our Project Timeline into 1 week
    "sprints" instead of the current 2 week phases that we had listed on the proposal. He also suggested that in each sprint listed that we specify the specific tasks to be
    completed by front-end, back-end, and general. The TA also made mention that he would like to see us create and present a system architecture diagram during next week's 
    meeting, in order to provide a clearer picture to how we plan to implement our tech stacks.
  Next Steps:
    Create system architecture diagram
    Update project timeline (phases -> sprints)
